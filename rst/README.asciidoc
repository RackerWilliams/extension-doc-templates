= Extension Documentation Template

== How to use the template

Simply fill in the blanks.  There are comments in the RST which give
further guidance.  If possible supply JSON and XML payload examples in
seperate files. Also, consider suppling a WADL if you're defining many
resources, it may actually save you some typing and it makes
consistent conversion to other formats possible.  See
+../docbook/src/docbkx/acme-temp.wadl+ for an example.
