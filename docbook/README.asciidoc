Extension Documentation Template
================================

== Building docs from the template

You will need the latest version of
http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.0/[Maven 3] to build the
documentation.

Simply type:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean install
----

After the build you should find a PDF in +target/docbkx/pdf/+ and a
web version in +target/docbkx/webhelp+.

== Template files

The template source is contained in +src/docbkx/+.  You will find the
following files in the directory.

|===========================================================
|+src/docbkx/acme-temp.xml+  | The docbook template.  This contains a narrative description of the extension.
|+src/docbkx/acme-temp.wadl+ | A WADL describing new REST resources.  This WADL can be directly referenced by the docbook text.
|+src/docbkx/figures+        | Example figures used by the template. You can put you custom figures and images here.  Note that figures need to come in twe flavors SVG and PNG.
|+src/docbkx/samples+        | Sample XML and JSON payloads referenced in the docbook or WADL.
